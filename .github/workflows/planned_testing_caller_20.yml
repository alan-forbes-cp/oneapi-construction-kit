# To add another llvm planned testing, simply copy this file and set the llvm_version and llvm_branch variables
# llvm_version is only used for tagging purposes, although ideally would be a number or main
# We may want to delete the lowest version for planned_testing_caller_*.yml at that time.
# If it is known to be unchanging, then set the 'use_llvm_github_cache: true' as an input to planned_testing_caller.yml/

# Note this will not affect normal PR runs which will require run_pr_tests_caller.yml to be updated.
